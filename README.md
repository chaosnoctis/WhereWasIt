A python script that navigates through a specified directory for a query and returns a list of what files contain the query

Haven't created this as a package manager for pip yet, so for right now, create from source.

cd WhereWasIt/
```
## Usage

After cloning the repository, run the main.py and follow the instructions shown in the program

Planning on adding more loops for a intuitive experience.
Also planning on adding more error handling and a test package in the near future
